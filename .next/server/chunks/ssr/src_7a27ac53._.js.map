Choose medium-loot locations like \r\n                    Georgopol Crates, Primorsk, or Farm for consistent loot without heavy early fights.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p className=\"text-sm text-dark-400\">\r\n                    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Avoid hot drops unless you are confident in early-game fights.

Compound buildings near zone center give you cover and \r\n                    multiple angles. Never get caught rotating late in the blue zone.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p className=\"text-sm text-dark-400\">\r\n                    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Use vehicles strategically - they are loud but essential for \r\n                    long rotations.
